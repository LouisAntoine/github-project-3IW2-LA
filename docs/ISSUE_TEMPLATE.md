# Issue Template

Congrats ! You find a problem on my project. 

Before filing an issue, do this checklist:

- [ ] Is this something you can **debug and fix**? Send a pull request! Bug fixes and documentation fixes are welcome.
- [ ] Have a usage question? Ask your question on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com). We use StackOverflow for usage question and GitHub for bugs.
- [ ] Have an idea for a feature? Send us the idea by email. GitHub issues should only be used for bugs.


None of the above, create a bug report
